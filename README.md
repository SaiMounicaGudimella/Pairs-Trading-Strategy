# Pairs-Trading-Strategy
A pairs trading algorithm based on mean reversion is a trading strategy that involves buying and selling two highly correlated assets that tend to move together. The strategy is based on the idea that when the price of an asset deviates from its mean price, it will eventually revert back to that mean.
